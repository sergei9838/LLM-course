# Active Context: LSO Landing Page

## 1. Current Work Focus

The primary focus is now on reconciling the project's documentation with the actual implementation. The initial code review is complete, and the next step is to address the discrepancies found.

## 2. Recent Changes

*   Completed the initial review of `index.html`, `style.css`, and `script.js`.
*   Established the complete core Memory Bank.

## 3. Next Steps

1.  **Update Documentation:** The `systemPatterns.md` and `progress.md` files need to be updated to reflect the implemented navigation fix.
2.  **Verify Fix:** The site should be tested to ensure the navigation highlighting now works correctly across all pages.
3.  **Full Site Review:** Proceed with a complete review of all pages to ensure consistency and functionality.
4.  **Content and Feature Alignment:** Systematically compare the site's content and features against the `projectbrief.md`.

## 4. Active Decisions & Considerations

*   **Documentation First:** The decision has been made to establish a comprehensive Memory Bank before diving into code changes. This ensures that all future work is aligned with the project's strategic goals.
*   **Initial Analysis:** The initial analysis of the file structure suggests a multi-page static site. This needs to be confirmed by reviewing the code.

## 5. Important Patterns & Preferences

*   **Clear Documentation:** The creation of the Memory Bank itself establishes a preference for clear, well-structured documentation.
*   **Vanilla Stack:** The project uses a simple, vanilla stack (HTML, CSS, JS), and this pattern should be maintained for consistency.

## 6. Learnings & Project Insights

*   **Architectural Mismatch Resolved:** The conflict between the multi-page HTML structure and the single-page JavaScript navigation logic has been resolved by updating `script.js` to correctly handle multi-page navigation.
*   **Testimonial Feature:** The `script.js` file includes logic for toggling testimonials, which confirms the importance of the "Who" section of the site.
