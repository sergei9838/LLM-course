# Tech Context: LSO Landing Page

## 1. Technologies Used

*   **HTML5:** For the structure and content of the web pages.
*   **CSS3:** For styling and layout.
*   **Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+):** For client-side interactivity. No external JavaScript frameworks or libraries are used.

## 2. Development Setup

*   **Local Development:** The project can be run by opening the `index.html` file in a web browser. No special servers or build tools are required.
*   **Editor:** Any standard code editor can be used (e.g., VSCode).
*   **Version Control:** (Assumption) Git is used for version control.

## 3. Technical Constraints

*   **No Backend:** The site is purely static. No server-side processing or database integration is possible without changing the architecture.
*   **Browser Compatibility:** The site should be tested on modern web browsers (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge). Specific compatibility requirements have not been defined.
*   **No Build Step:** The absence of a build process means no pre-processors (like Sass or TypeScript) or bundlers (like Webpack) are in use. All code is written directly in its final form.

## 4. Dependencies

There are no external package dependencies (e.g., from npm). The project is self-contained.

## 5. Tool Usage Patterns

*   **File Naming:** HTML files are named semantically based on their content (e.g., `what.html`, `pricing.html`).
*   **Styling:** A single, global stylesheet (`style.css`) is used.
*   **Scripting:** A single, global script file (`script.js`) is used.
