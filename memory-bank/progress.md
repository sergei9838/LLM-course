# Progress: LSO Landing Page

## 1. What Works

*   **Initial Documentation:** The core Memory Bank files (`projectbrief.md`, `productContext.md`, `systemPatterns.md`, `techContext.md`, `activeContext.md`) have been created. This provides a solid foundation for understanding the project.
*   **Existing Site Structure:** A set of HTML files exists, suggesting that the basic structure of the landing page is in place.

## 2. What's Left to Build

*   **Resolve Navigation Conflict:** The immediate priority is to fix the broken navigation system by aligning the JavaScript logic with the HTML structure.
*   **Full Site Review:** After fixing the navigation, a complete review of all pages is needed to ensure they are consistent and functional.
*   **Content and Feature Alignment:** The site's content and features need to be systematically compared against the `projectbrief.md` to ensure all requirements are met.

## 3. Current Status

The project has moved from **Discovery and Documentation** to the **Analysis and Planning** phase. A critical architectural issue has been identified and must be resolved.

## 4. Known Issues

*   **[Resolved] Architectural Mismatch:** The conflict between the multi-page HTML structure and single-page navigation logic has been resolved. The `script.js` file was updated to correctly handle navigation for a multi-page site.

## 5. Evolution of Project Decisions

*   **Initial Decision:** The first decision made in this session was to create the Memory Bank to establish a clear, documented understanding of the project before proceeding with any code changes.
