                <h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>

                <!-- Question 1 -->
                <div class="qa-block">
                    <h2>Why choose LearnStatistics.online (LSO)? How does it enhance learning compared to a traditional problem book?</h2>
                    <div class="qa-content">
                        <img src="images/qa-illust1.jpg" alt="Illustration comparing a book to an interactive screen" class="qa-illustration">
                        <div class="qa-text">
                            <p>Books are invaluable resources for learning and practicing statistics—many of us at LSO learned this way ourselves. We love books! But the limitations are clear: without immediate feedback, we had to wait for tutorials to see if our answers were correct. How often did we wish for a hint or a quick way to check our solutions? LSO brings this wish to life, offering instant feedback, hints, and answer reveals at your fingertips.</p>
                            <p>Nearly two decades of using the LSO system in university teaching has shown us that students love the interactive approach. LSO fits seamlessly with how newer generations learn—it’s like a computer game: you dive in, experiment, and learn from your attempts rather than starting with a dense manual. When you get “stuck” or “defeated” on a question, there’s always help available. Just as you’d use a game walkthrough, LSO’s integrated Study Guide is there to boost you to the next level, reinforcing your understanding and guiding you through challenging concepts.</p>

                <!-- Question 2 -->
                <div class="qa-block image-right">
                    <h2>Do I need any prior knowledge of statistics to use this platform?</h2>
                    <div class="qa-content">
                        <img src="images/qa-illust2.jpg" alt="Illustration of a beginner's learning path" class="qa-illustration">
                        <div class="qa-text">
                            <p>No, you do not need any previous knowledge of statistics to get started on LearnStatistics.online. However, a general understanding of basic school-level mathematics, such as algebra and arithmetic, will certainly be beneficial for following along more comfortably.</p>
                            <p>Our integrated Study Guide will walk you through the essential theoretical background and give you practical examples. It also includes instructions on how to use statistical software for answering questions in each topic covered, making it easier for beginners to gain hands-on experience.</p>

                <!-- Question 3 -->
                <div class="qa-block">
                    <h2>Can I get help if I’m struggling with a concept?</h2>
                    <div class="qa-content">
                        <img src="images/qa-illust3.jpg" alt="Illustration of help icons like hints and answers" class="qa-illustration">
                        <div class="qa-text">
                            <p>If you’re having trouble with a particular question, there are several ways to get help. After you submit any answer (even if it's incorrect), you’ll see a “Give me the answer” button at the bottom of the question window. Clicking this will reveal the correct answer, which you can analyze to understand where you might have gone wrong. But we recommend first clicking the “Give me a hint” button. This will direct you to the relevant chapter in the Study Guide, allowing you to review the theory and build your understanding before attempting the answer again. This way you will reinforce your learning by revisiting core concepts.</p>
                            <p>If you're still unsure after reviewing, you can submit any answer to reveal the “Give me the answer” button at the bottom of the question window. By analysing the provided answer, you can identify where you may have gone off-track. For further assistance, you can also explore online resources like ChatGPT or Google's Gemini, or access paid support from our experienced professional staff for personalised guidance.</p>

                <!-- Question 4 -->
                <div class="qa-block image-right">
                    <h2>What software can I use to solve LSO questions?</h2>
                    <div class="qa-content">
                        <img src="images/qa-illust4.jpg" alt="Logos of Matlab, R, Python, and Excel" class="qa-illustration">
                        <div class="qa-text">
                            <p>You’re welcome to use any software you have for computations, but be aware that minor variations can occur between programs. For instance, there isn’t a universally accepted method for calculating percentiles (in particular, quartiles), so Matlab’s results will differ slightly from those in Excel or R.</p>
                            <p>To help maintain consistency, the LSO system supports four popular software tools: Matlab, R, Python, and Excel. Selecting one from the menu will ensure that your submissions are graded accurately, and it will also reformat data for easy copy-pasting into the software you choose. Our Study Guide includes computation examples in all four, making it easy to follow along and learn in the environment that suits you best.</p>

                <!-- Question 5 -->
                <div class="qa-block">
                    <h2>Are there certifications or assessments available?</h2>
                    <div class="qa-content">
                        <img src="images/qa-illust5.jpg" alt="Illustration of a formal certificate" class="qa-illustration">
                        <div class="qa-text">
                            <p>We do not collect personal data; the name you provide when registering is only used to display your learning performance metrics. Since we don't verify your identity or who completes the quizzes, we cannot issue a formal certification of your knowledge based solely on your activity on the platform.</p>
                            <p>However, for an additional fee, we can arrange for an exam in a controlled environment at one of our affiliated universities. If you successfully pass this proctored exam, we can issue a named certificate that verifies your understanding of the material covered. This option provides a credible acknowledgement of your knowledge.</p>
