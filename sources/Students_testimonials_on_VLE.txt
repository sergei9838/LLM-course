First of all I'd like to say that I really like the VLE-system, I am retaking this year's course since I failed it last year, and I must say that this year's course is multiple times better than last year's in every single way, partially due to the VLE-system but not only, I also think that the study guide is very good!

I'm part of the educational committee of the M.E. student guild, i.e. I represent all of the M.E. students during my tenure (which ends in july). And I must say that the students I talked to the past weeks says that they are very happy having you as a teacher and examiner, keep up the good work.

First I want to say that I am truly glad that you are so committed to making this course the best possible, and the content of this email is just further proof of this commitment. The email has been sent less than 12 hours since the problems were discovered and it contains clear information and suggestions for a solution. Truly impressive compared to the average lecturer here at Chalmers.

No worries! We students love your humble approach and everyone I've spoken with is more than positive to the course as a whole in your regime. I am engaged in education questions in the local student union at mechanical engineering and I don't think that I've ever heard so many positive reviews when introducing a new concept. Keep up the good work!

First and foremost, thank you for a good course-layout! I really like VLE and how it eases the studying of this subject which was previously known to be pretty hard.

Thank you for the democratic and fair way you let us decide what to do with the results for test1! I certainly enjoy VLE as a teaching environment, and in time I'm sure that all it's potential will become evident to other lecturers as well so we can have it in more courses. At least I'm hoping so.

I want to point out, since I have been giving a lot of suggestions during the course, that I really do think that your way of teaching is incredible and that I?m not doing it to complain.

Even if we are test pilots for this course I must say it's one of the most well-organized courses I've attended at Chalmers! Well done Sergei!

Thank you vey much! It has truly been a really fascinating course, and I really want want to thank you for it! I have always liked statistics, but this gave me a much deeper understanding, and I'm really wanting to learn even more. The VLE platform has too been a great help, making it very fun to study!
